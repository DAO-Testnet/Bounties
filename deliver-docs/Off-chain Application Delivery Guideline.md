**Off-chain Application Delivery Guideline**

**Step 1: Copy the Template**

Developers are required to follow the DApp design plan and submit the PR (pull request) with a Development Delivery File (reference template:[ deliver-template](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/deliver-template.md)) to the[ GitHub ‘Bounty Project’](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties). Developers need to click the [deliver-template.md](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/deliver-template.md) file to view the project release requirements and copy the document content. The template is for reference only and specific content can be supplemented or modified according to the project release documents:

**Step 2: Create a New Document**

Developers need to go to the corresponding project’s ‘[deliver-docs](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/tree/master/deliver-docs)’ folder, and need to paste the content of the [deliver-template.md](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/deliver-template.md) document into their new document, revising it according to the project’s release document before clicking ‘propose’ to submit it. The development delivery File is recommended to be named: ‘*Project Name*’-’*stage*’-‘development delivery File’.

**Step 3: Create & Submit Pr**

If the project needs to be developed in multiple stages, a folder for each stage of the project will need to be created in the [deliver-docs](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/tree/master/deliver-docs) folder, and documents submitted to the corresponding folder according to the stage plan.
