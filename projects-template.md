# Bounty Project: Release Template

For Chinese templates, please refer to: [project-template-zh](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/projects-templete-zh.md)

The Committee provides community users two ways to participate in aelf’s development, encouraging an active ecosystem: Grant Projects and Bounty Projects:

* [Grant Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants): When community users have good project ideas that will be beneficial to the aelf ecosystem, they can apply as a Grant project. The Committee will provide resources to aid the project’s development.
* [Bounty Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties): When the Committee sees the need to enhance aelf’s ecosystem, a Bounty project will be launched to allow community users to assist in project development.

aelf DAO Management Committee Members need to refer to this section when applying for [bounty projects:](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties) 

The following is for reference only, you need to provide a complete development delivery document based on the specific project circumstances.

**Note:** The detailed steps associated with this document can be found in the developer's instruction: [operation-guide](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/operation-guide.md)



## Project name

## Project Description
* Brief description - project design, functions, etc.
* Describe how and why the project will benefit the development of the aelf’s ecosystem.

## Awards
Please provide the total amount of the reward, the number of participants, the rules of reward distribution, etc.

## Team Requirements

(reference template: [apply-template](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties/blob/master/apply-template.md))

## Development Roadmap
The project can be divided into several stages according to the development difficulty, practicability, or other factors. Each stage should have a detailed development plan, development time, and budget. Development delivery documents will be checked and accepted with reference to the development plan.

The project plan for each phase should include the following: 

* Project cost: Determine the amount of funds required according to the development cost.
* Number of developers: total number of people involved in development.
* Development Time: The development time of each member or the total development time of all members.
* Project Development Content: Developers need to ensure that the development content of the project at this stage is complete so that the aelf DAO management committee can review whether the project’s development conforms to the specifications.
* Project delivery documentation requirements: Developers are required to submit documents such as project requirement specification, project design specification, user instruction, test report, etc.
