* [Grant Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants): When community users have good project ideas that will be beneficial to the aelf ecosystem, they can apply as a Grant project. The Committee will provide resources to aid the project’s development.

[Bounty Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties): When the Committee sees the need to enhance aelf’s ecosystem, a Bounty project will be launched to allow community users to assist in project development..
